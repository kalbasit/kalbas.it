Hi there! My name is Wael. I'm a Lebanese-born Software Engineer (or SWE), Site
Reliability Engineer (or SRE) and Software Architect living in San Francisco
Bay Area. I'm currently employed by [KeepTruckin](https://KeepTruckin.com) as a
Principal Architect in the Platform team, leading the team in charge of the
overall architecture of the product, and the infrastructure orchestrating it.

I have made [many Open-Source
contributions](https://github.com/pulls?q=author%3Akalbasit+sort%3Aupdated-desc),
and I strive to give back to the community to the best of my abilities. All of
my personal projects, be it a one-off script or a large project, are available
on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/kalbasit).

In my free time, I like to spend time with my kids, and work with my hands.

# Career Biography

I've started learning development at the age 12. I owned a Casio Graph 100 back
then, and I've learned C and assembly in order to write programs for it. As
someone who yearns for knowledge, I've experimented with many different angles
of Software development. I've hacked mobile phones, designed and wrote
websites, wrote backend applications and APIs, and managed servers as pets and
cattle.

As a teenager, I worked as a computer technician at a local company. That
taught me a lot about the machine at the hardware level, and allowed me to
expand my understanding of a typical program and the path such program must
follow. And one day, in the late '90s, I got exposed to Linux, my operating
system of choice since 2001. Read about my [Linux history below](#linux-history).

At the age of 18, I moved to France to get my education done

## Linux history

Linux, in many ways, has had an important impact on my career. Here's the
timeline of my involvement in Linux distributions:

- 2001: After trying many different distributions, I've settled on using Debian.
- 2005: Ubuntu has just recently came out, and delivered a much nice interface
        than Debian. I became quite invested in the project, and took on the
        task of a beta tester and a forum moderator.
- 2006: I discovered Arch, and decided to move to it. I very much liked the
	simplicity of [pacman](https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/) and
	[PKGBUILD](https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/PKGBUILD.5.html) files.
- 2006: I started my own Distribution, purely for educational purposes. This
        helped me understand the boot sequence, and also allowed me to create
        my own version of Kernel initialization very much aligned with Arch's
        mkinitcpio. My work helped fix a few bugs
        ([example](https://git.archlinux.org/mkinitcpio.git/commit/?id=e93d33835fc2078eafe5c4d923367e1e95f66822)).
