Hi there! My name is Wael. I'm a Lebanese-born Software Engineer (or SWE), Site
Reliability Engineer (or SRE) and Software Architect living in San Francisco
Bay Area. I'm currently employed by [KeepTruckin][keeptruckin] as a Principal
Architect in the Platform team, leading the team in charge of the overall
architecture of the product, and the infrastructure orchestrating it.

I have made [many Open-Source contributions][os-contribs], and I strive to give
back to the community to the best of my abilities. All of my personal projects,
be it a one-off script or a large project, are available on my [GitHub
account][my-github].

In my free time, I like to spend time with my family.

# Background

## Early Career

I've started learning development at the age 12. I owned a Casio Graph 100 back
then, and I've learned C and assembly in order to write programs for it --
unconventional programs in a sense. As someone who yearns for knowledge, I've
experimented with many different angles of Software development. I've hacked
mobile phones, designed and wrote websites, wrote backend applications and
APIs, and managed servers as pets and cattle.

As a teenager, I worked as a computer technician at a local company. That
taught me a lot about the machine at the hardware level, and allowed me to
expand my understanding of a typical program and the path such program must
follow. And one day, in the late '90s, I got exposed to Linux, my operating
system of choice since 2001. Please read all about my [Linux/Unix
history][linux-unix-history].

At the age of 19, I moved to France for University, and I worked at Telcos to
help me pay the bills. After my graduation, I started working for Weem followed
by Agence Durable and soon after I moved to the US.
