Wael Nasreddine -- Software Engineer (or SWE), Site Reliability Engineer (or
SRE) and Software Architect living in San Francisco Bay Area. Currently,
employed by [KeepTruckin][keeptruckin] as a Principal Architect in the Platform

and the infrastructure orchestrating it.

I have made [many Open-Source contributions][os-contribs], and I strive to give
back to the community to the best of my abilities. All of my personal projects,
be it a one-off script or a large project, are available on my [GitHub
account][my-github].

In my free time, I like to spend time with my family.

# Background

I've started learning development at the age 12 in Lebanon. I owned a Casio
Graph 100 back then, and I've learned C and assembly in order to write programs
for it -- unconventional programs in a sense. As someone who yearns for
knowledge, I've experimented with many different angles of Software
development. I've hacked mobile phones, designed and wrote websites, wrote
backend applications and APIs, and managed servers as [pets and cattle][pets-vs-cattle].

Between the age of 13 and 18, I worked as a computer technician at my local
computer store. I gained experience in understanding the machine at the
hardware level, and gained knowledge of a typical program and the path such
program must follow. And one day, in the late '90s, I got exposed to Linux, my
operating system of choice since 2001. Please read all about my [Linux/Unix
history][linux-unix-history].

At the age of 19 I moved to France and pursued my education in Engineering at
the University of Rennes 1. During my student years, I also worked at Telcos.
After my graduation, I started working for Weem followed by Agence Durable and
soon after I moved to the US.
