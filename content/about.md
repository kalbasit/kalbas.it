# Career Biography

<!--

I've started learning development at the age 12. I owned a Casio Graph 100 back
then, and I've learned C and assembly in order to write programs for it. I've
been expanding my knoweldge ever since.

As a teen ager, I worked as a computer technician at a local company. That
taught me a lot about the machine at the hardware level, and allowed me to
expand my understanding of a typical program and the path such program must
follow. And one day, in the late '90s, I got exposed to Linux, my operating
system of choice since 2001.

Linux, in many ways, had an important impact on my carrer. And for that I think
it deserves it's own section in my career biography. In the early 2000's,
probably early 2004
