Hi there! My name is Wael. I'm a Lebanese-born Software Engineer (or SWE), Site
Reliability Engineer (or SRE) and Software Architect living in San Francisco
Bay Area. I'm currently employed by [KeepTruckin](https://KeepTruckin.com) as a
Principal Architect in the Platform team, leading the team in charge of the
overall architecture of the product, and the infrastructure orchestrating it.

I have made [many Open-Source
contributions](https://github.com/pulls?q=author%3Akalbasit+sort%3Aupdated-desc),
and I strive to give back to the community to the best of my abilities. All of
my personal projects, be it a one-off script or a large project, are available
on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/kalbasit).

In my free time, I like to spend time with my kids, and work with my hands.

# Career Biography

I've started learning development at the age 12. I owned a Casio Graph 100 back
then, and I've learned C and assembly in order to write programs for it. As
someone who yearns for knowledge, I've experimented with many different angles
of Software development. I've hacked mobile phones, designed and wrote
websites, wrote backend applications and APIs, and managed servers as pets and
cattle.

As a teenager, I worked as a computer technician at a local company. That
taught me a lot about the machine at the hardware level, and allowed me to
expand my understanding of a typical program and the path such program must
follow. And one day, in the late '90s, I got exposed to Linux, my operating
system of choice since 2001. Read about my [Linux history]({{< ref "linux-unix-history" >}}).

At the age of 18, I moved to France to get my education done
