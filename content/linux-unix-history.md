Linux, in many ways, has had an important impact on my career. Below, you can
find the timeline of my linux history:

- 2001: After trying many different distributions, I've settled on using Debian.
- 2005: Ubuntu has just recently came out, and delivered a much nice interface
        than Debian. I became quite invested in the project, and took on the
        task of a beta tester and a forum moderator.
- 2006: I discovered Arch, and decided to move to it. I very much liked the
        simplicity of [pacman](https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/) and
        [PKGBUILD](https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/PKGBUILD.5.html) files.
- 2006: I started my own Distribution, purely for educational purposes. This
        helped me understand the boot sequence, and also allowed me to create
        my own version of Kernel initialization very much aligned with Arch's
        mkinitcpio. My work helped fix a few bugs
        ([example](https://git.archlinux.org/mkinitcpio.git/commit/?id=e93d33835fc2078eafe5c4d923367e1e95f66822)).
- 2006: My server has been running Linux for about two years, and it was time
        to switch to FreeBSD.
- 2007: I switched to Gentoo because I wanted more customizations, and Arch did
        not offer an easy way to do this.
- 2008: I was getting a bit tired of compiling the world, so I've switched over
        to using Sabayon, and quickly became a core member. I was later givin
        the title Chief development officer in charge of the packages.
- 2012: I switched over to using Mac full-time for my workstation, and I kept
        my servers running Arch.
- 2017: Back to Linux land after Apple has gotten rid of the ESC key. I chose
        Arch because I've been running it on my Server and Desktop at Home and seemed
        to be an easier switch.
- 2018: I switched all of my machines (workstations and servers) over to NixOS.
