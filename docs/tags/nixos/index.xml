Introduction This post highlights my reasoning behind switching to NixOS.
Linux/Unix History Please head over to read all about my Linux/Unix history. In a Gist: I have about 20 years experience in using and managing Linux and Unix machines ranging from various Linux distributions, as well as *BSD and by extension Darwin (a.k.a Mac).
Why did I switch to NixOS? Last year &amp;ndash; 2018 &amp;ndash; I was still working as a co-founder of a small Ad-related startup.</description>
