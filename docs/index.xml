      <description>This post goes over configuring Tailscale DNS to support DNS resolution from other AppVMs using the Tailscale VM.
This guide assumes you already have Tailscale configured in a TemplateVM and a sys-tailscale AppVM is running Tailscaled for other AppVMs to use. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have Tailscale already configured, then please head over to taradiddles&amp;rsquo; excellent guide over on the Qubes forum.
We need to do the following on the TemplateVM to get it all configured:</description>

      <title>Announcing the new Golang infrastructure: buildGoModule</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/57080&#34;&gt;recently introduced&lt;/a&gt; a new
function in Nixpkgs named &lt;code&gt;buildGoModule&lt;/code&gt;. The new function allows you to
package Go application (or modules) with ease, provided the modules have added
support for &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules&#34;&gt;Go modules&lt;/a&gt; upstream.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Manage a static website with Hugo and Nix</title>
      <link>https://kalbas.it/2019/02/26/manage-a-static-website-with-hugo-and-nix/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Hugo on and off for my
blog, as well as for some static websites I maintain. On many occasions,
I have started to hack on my site, only to realsize that my theme &amp;ndash; as
submoduled into the repository &amp;ndash; is no longer compatible with the
most recent version of Hugo that I have installed on my system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post describes how to migrate from an environment controlled
by the host operating system to a reproducible environment regardless of
the host.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Setup a website on AWS with CoreOS and Docker</title>
      <link>https://kalbas.it/2016/08/21/setup-a-website-on-aws-with-coreos-and-docker/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been quite some time since I shared my knowledge and the daily
challenges that I overcome. I always wanted to get back into writing as
it has always been therapeutic for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about how this blog is being hosted. We will
start from the top down by looking first at the application level, then
we will take a look at the hosting, the deployment, the server and
finally the cloud provisioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;micro-containerized-cluster&#34;&gt;Micro-Containerized cluster&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most ideal stack today would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etcd2 cluster with at least 5 nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes cluster with at least 3 master nodes and 2 minion nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s encrypt generated SSL certificates for all websites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Route53 for managing the DNS zones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All managed using Terraform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I did for work, but it&amp;rsquo;s way overkill and
financially unacceptable for a blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stack I designed for this blog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One t2.micro instance running NginX containers with support for SSL
certificates from Let&amp;rsquo;s encrypt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Route53 for managing the DNS zones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All managed using Terraform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>I have been breaking Unix since 2001©</title>

      <description>Linux, in many ways, has had an important impact on my career.
Ever since I discovered Linux back in the late &amp;lsquo;90s, I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in some way or another with Unix but not until 2001 that I really got into it. I used to spend my time developing on Windows© beforehand, and I never really knew what I was missing!
Below, you can find the timeline of my Unix history:</description>
